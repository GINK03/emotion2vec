In his computer! Actually inside his computer. It worked! The password is well done. If xxx4 name over xxx5 got IP address and password, I'll tell him [never] in the video.\n(2:14-)\nIsn't amazing that I got my shell on my computer - well, raspberry pi -, and my dad's got his shell opened on his Macintosh computer. And I can connect only miles xxx6 pi to his Macintosh computer. When it isn't xxx7 xxx8 I got my raspberry Pi. Crazy. But we did it.\n(2:39-)\nNow if we type in who. That's the xxx9 words. xxx10. And show you obviously who xxx11 computer. Now you can see my dad's got logged in, alex  and he's got some of the shell opened. Let's xxx12 xxx13. Hah. That's good xxx14. xxx15 as logged xxx16. Alex.
