{"context": "The mobile app development boom is at its peak with innovators digging in deep to explore the untouched world of mobile applications. Their urge to innovate never dies, which keeps them at par in building new meaningful and useful applications.\nThe blooming mobile trend has also asked business owners to make a quick shift in adopting mobile app technologies to keep up with the market\u2019s pace. But, where to invest? Native app development or hybrid app development? The question remains unanswered. \nThe above-stated question not only haunts business owners but also mobile development companies around the globe. The pressure on development companies has also risen due to ever-changing technology and companies\u2019 demand for top-quality products. According to a survey, it is found that only 16% of users would retry a failed app more than two times while 79% admitted a max of two attempts for the same. This creates an additional pressure on mobile development companies to produce quality applications.\nAs a business owner, it\u2019s important to identify your targeted audience and their favorable platform. This will help you in taking your final call on whether you should go for a native mobile app or a hybrid app.\nNot lingering on much, I\u2019d like to shoot following questions to you, which may help you in deciding if native is your cup of tea.\nDoes your targeted audience use iOS or Android or likewise?\nAs a business owner, you need to figure out what is the preferred platform for your potential customers? Do they use Android, iOS, Windows, Blackberry or Symbian? This will play a crucial role in dictating future terms. It\u2019ll help you to decide on a single platform, which you need to consider for the native app development process. \nIf your answer to this question is more than one platform then I\u2019m afraid to say, native can\u2019t be your choice. Go for hybrid instead. \nThe cost of developing a native app is directly proportional to the number of platforms you want it to be built in. Not, just the cost, but time, expertise and efforts go hand in hand as well. So, before taking a step forward you need to be crystal clear about the platform you want to target. \nWhat\u2019s your budget?\nBudgeting is one of the prime factors for mobile app development agencies as in most of the cases, the budget is finalized before a green signal is given to the development team. Defining a platform is, therefore, important for any development company to get things started.\nNative apps are generally expensive as compared to hybrid ones. You require a specific bunch of professionals to create apps for different platforms, which can directly be related to increased cost. Hybrid apps, on the contrary, are cost effective and platform independent. Developer uses \u201cwrite once and publish anywhere\u201d technique in case of hybrid apps, which not only saves time and money but also gives you an advantage of staying ahead of your competition.\nDoes user experience hold utmost priority to you?\nThe question here is that can you afford to compromise on user experience? User experience plays an important part in app\u2019s success and growth. If users aren\u2019t happy how can you expect to excel in this competitive world of mobile apps? \nNative apps provide a seamless user experience because they are fast, reliable and most importantly content is already there on user\u2019s device. The website\u2019s static content gets downloaded on user\u2019s smart device, which helps instant loading regardless of user\u2019s phone or device connected to a wireless connection. This results in a seamless experience for the user every time he/she opens the app. \nOn the other side, hybrid apps being platform independent aren\u2019t really efficient to deliver the same level of experience as in case of native apps. After putting in all the cross-platform knowledge, skills and expertise the resultant can\u2019t deliver, what you call an exceptional experience. Even the best of user experience architect can\u2019t cater two different dominant players of the market: iPhone and Android users. Although, the code is written to fit both, but their style guidelines are just different from one another. \nIs time a constraint?\nIf there is a particular deadline for the completion of project, then it is advised to go for hybrid app development. Building an app for a particular platform complying to its guidelines requires more time than developing a cross-platform app. Since the team needs to write the code once that can serve the purpose for multiple platforms, the app will be ready and running in the least time. While platform-dependent app requires writing different code for different platforms.\nDo you need to target all users at once?\nAnother question, which you need to ask yourself is if there is a necessity to target each platform at once? There are app owners who targeted either iOS or Android or Windows (a rare possibility) first, then after a period of time moved to a different platform. \nYou need to identify your needs, requirements, purpose and targets beforehand. This will help you in deciding if you want to hit the market extensively or you can hold it back for a while. \nNative and hybrid apps have their own positives and negatives. Asking the aforementioned questions prior to your project will help you in making a wise decision. Use your wisdom and make right choices. As they say, great choices make great products and who knows your next project can bring a revolution.\nThe mobile app development boom is at its peak with innovators digging in deep to explore the untouched world of mobile applications.
