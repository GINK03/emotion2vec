It should look like this:\n\nCMakeLists.txt\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)\nproject( DisplayImage )\nfind_package( OpenCV REQUIRED )\ninclude_directories( ${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS} )\nadd_executable( DisplayImage DisplayImage.cpp )\ntarget_link_libraries( DisplayImage ${OpenCV_LIBS} )\n\n\nGenerate the executable\nThis part is easy, just proceed as with any other project using CMake:\ncd <DisplayImage_directory>\ncmake .\nmake\n\nResult\nBy now you should have an executable (called DisplayImage in this case). You just have to run it giving an image location as an argument, i.e.:\n./DisplayImage lena.jpg\n\nYou should get a nice window as the one shown below:\n\n\nOpencv\nhttp://docs.opencv.org/trunk/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_gcc_cmake/linux_gcc_cmake.html\n\ncmake\nhttp://www.wakayama-u.ac.jp/~chen/cmake/cmakecv.html\n\n\u305d\u306e\u307e\u307e\u3067\u3059\u304c\u524d\u63d0.\ngcc,OpenCV,CMake\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u6e08\u307f\u3002\n\n\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d7\n1.DisplayImage.cpp\n2.CMake file CMakeLists.txt\n3.cmake make\n4.Run\n\nUsing OpenCV with gcc and CMake\nNote We assume that you have successfully installed OpenCV in your workstation.\nThe easiest way of using OpenCV in your code is to use CMake.
