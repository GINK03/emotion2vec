Today I will be showing you what a Capacitive proximity sensor is. Capacitive Proximity sensors can be used to  sensible metallic and non-metallic materials. Some ideal applications include Liquid level detection, Material level control, Counting, and Induction molding processes, such as a detection level of plastic pellets in the beat-whopper.\n[\u88dc\u8db3] metallic \u306f l\u304c2\u3064\u3068\u3044\u3046\u306e\u306f\u521d\u3081\u3066\u77e5\u3063\u305f\n[\u88dc\u8db3] beat-whopper \u3068\u3044\u3046\u3082\u306e\u306f\u672a\u6d88\u5316\n(0:30-)\nThe capacitor consists of two metal plates, separated by insulator called \"Dielectric\". Capacitive Proximity Sensors can detect any target that has dielectric constant greater than air. \n(0:42-)\nThe Dielectric constant is electric static field generated by the oscillator circuit. If the object enters this field causes  interference, oscillation then begins. The detector will trigger the circuit monitor the oscillator output. When it detects sufficient change in the field, it switches on the output circuit.\n(1:03-)\nThe output circuit remains active until the target is removed from the sensing field. Sensing ranges can depend on the material needed to be detected. There is no de-rating factor to be applied when sensing metal targets. \n(1:18-)\nBut other materials do affect the sensing range. Sensors can be used to detect liquid through non-matellic materials, such as glass or plastic. But they need to be mounted so that the sensor detects just the liquid not the container.\n(1:40-)\nGenerally, the sensing distance for Capacitive Proximity sensors is greater, for larger or denser targets. But the effects of electro-static field produced by non-conductive material can be quite small. Usually sensing distance with this material is short. \n(1:53-)\nMaterials such as ungrounded conductive material can be sensed from further away because it causes more interference in the electro-static field. Grounded conductive material causes even more interference and thus has a longer sensing distance.\n(2:11-)\nSince the composition of the material and ambient condition can have an impact on the sensing field, many Capacitive Proximity sensors are equipped with sensitivity adjustment potentiometers.\n[\u88dc\u8db3] potentiometers \u79cb\u6708\u96fb\u5b50\n(2:19-)\nCapacitive Proximity switches(sensors?) can detect materials in greater ranges from inductive sensors and have a long operation life.
