Includes automated OS installation and custom ISOs by using sysprep (Windows) or cloudinit (Linux).\n\nAcropolis Drivers for OpenStack\nThese drivers facilitate consuming the Nutanix Acropolis infrastructure as a cloud service or for use in a data center. For example, an OpenStack implementation might require using features such as single sign-on, orchestration, role based access control, and so on. Drivers include Acropolis compute, image, volume, and network drivers.\n\nVolume Group Support Improved\nREST API and intuitive Prism web console support has been added, as well as including Acropolis command line support.\n\nGuest VM VLAN Trunking\nAHV supports guest VM VLAN tagging, where the tag passes through a single port from the physical network to a VM. It allows the VLAN ID tags to be included in an Ethernet packet to be passed to the guest VM. Guest VM operating systems can use this feature to enable Virtual Guest Tagging (VGT) and simulate multiple virtual NICs.\n\nNutanix Guest Tools\nNutanix Guest Agent (NGA) service. Communicates with the Nutanix Controller VM.\nFile Level Restore (FLR) CLI. Performs self-service file-level recovery from the VM snapshots.\nVSS requestor and hardware provider for Windows VMs. Enables application-consistent snapshots of Windows VMs.\nApplication-consistent snapshot for Linux VMs. Supports application-consistent snapshots for Linux VMs by running specific scripts on VM quiesce.\n\nSelf-Service Restore\nSelf-service restore allows a user to restore a file within a virtual machine from the Nutanix protected snapshot with minimal Nutanix administrator intervention. To perform these operations, you need to install and configure NGT on the VMs.\n\nAHV Security Updates\nNew users or anyone performing a fresh install will already have an updated glibc and openssl packages. Existing users should \"yum update\" on the host and update at least these two packages, preferably everything that yum will offer updates for.\n\nPrism Central does not currently operate with Community Edition. When the next CE release occurs, Prism Central will allow registration of CE clusters and support the full functionality.\nNutanix Community Edition\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u7248\u300eVersion ce-2016.03.03-stable\u300f\u304c\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff01\n\u4eca\u56de\u306e\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u306f\u3001\u5546\u7528\u7248\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b Acropolis Base Software 4.6 \u304c\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u3068\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\n\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u306f\u3001\u4e0b\u8a18\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u5148\u304b\u3089\u53f3\u5074\u306e[Download Software]\u3092\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u3057\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002\uff08\u8981\u30ed\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\uff09\nhttp://next.nutanix.com/t5/Nutanix-Community-Edition/ct-p/Nutanix-Community-Edition\n\n\u7ffb\u8a33\u3084\u88dc\u8db3\u306f\u5225\u9014\u884c\u3044\u305f\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u53d6\u308a\u6025\u304e\u3001\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u4e00\u89a7\u3092\u8ee2\u8f09\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\n# **\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u4e00\u89a7** \n- **Acropolis File Services**  \nProvides file server capability within a Nutanix AHV cluster, as one or more network-attached VMs, to form a virtual file server.\n- **Acropolis App Mobility Fabric - Windows or Linux Guest Customization**    \nCustomize or clone Windows or Linux guest VMs hosted by AHV.
