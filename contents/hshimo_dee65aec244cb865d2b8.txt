It is set to zero in most transactions to indicate immediate propagation and execution. If locktime is nonzero and below 500 million, it is interpreted as a block height, meaning the transaction is not valid and is not relayed or included in the blockchain prior to the specified block height. If it is above 500 million, it is interpreted as a Unix Epoch timestamp (seconds since Jan-1-1970) and the transaction is not valid prior to the specified time. Transactions with locktime specifying a future block or time must be held by the originating system and transmitted to the bitcoin network only after they become valid. The use of locktime is equivalent to postdating a paper check.\n\n\nDeveloper Guide\n\nDeveloper Guide - Bitcoin\n\n\nmempool\n\nsecurity - Can nLockTime TX be used to flood Mempools? - Bitcoin Stack Exchange\n\n\nWhat is \"Sequence Number\"?\n\nbitcoin.org\n\nSequence Number (Transactions) - Bitcoin Glossary\n\n\nPart of all transactions.
