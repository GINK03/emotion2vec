But it doesn't bundle any utility tools for Mac OS X.\nThe GPSBabel, a open source GPS data management tool, supports GT-730FL-S as a SkyTraq compatible device. It can manage the GPS data on the device, as well as the device configurations.\nThis post explains how you can manage your GT-730FL-S device using GPSBabel.\n\nSoftware versions\n\nMac OS X 10.10\nGPSBabel (built from source)\n\nSince the latest GPSBabel (1.5.3) has an issue , I needed to fix it and build the tool from the source code.

You'll need to wait for my patch would be merged into the latest release.\n\nInstall USB Serial driver\nThe GT-730FL-S has an USB connector, but its logical interface is a serial port. You need an USB serial driver to connect it to your Mac and communicate with.\nI'm using PL2303 driver to connect my GT-730FL-S to my MacBook.\n\nCommand samples\n\nCheck the device file\nIf you plug your GT-730FL-S into your Mac and turn the power on, it will be mounted as a device file. You can check the device file as follows.\nls /dev/cu.*\n/dev/cu.usbmodem1421\n\nIf you would see multiple device files in the output, please try the following command one by one. You'll find a device file which would work.\n./gpsbabel -i skytraq -f /dev/cu.<foo> \nFailed to open port (Resource busy)\nskytraq: Can't open port '/dev/cu.<foo>'\n\nIf you won't see any device files with the ls /dev/cu.*, or all /dev/cu.* won't work, please check the followings.\n\nPlease make sure you installed the USB driver correctly.\nYou plugged your device into your Mac.\nYou turned the power of the device on.\n\nIn the following sections, let's assume /dev/cu.usbmodem1421 as the device file for your GT-730FL-S.\n\nCheck the current status of the device\nYou can specify debug level as -D parameter.
