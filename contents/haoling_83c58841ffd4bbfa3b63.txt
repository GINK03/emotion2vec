It comes from this site, I copy and paste for readers' convenience:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nPROFILE_NAME=$1\nmkdir -p \"/Applications/Google Chrome $1.app/Contents/MacOS\"\n\nF=\"/Applications/Google Chrome $1.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome $1\"\ncat > \"$F\" <<\\EOF\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#\n# Google Chrome for Mac with additional profile.\n#\n\n# Name your profile:\nEOF\n\necho \"PROFILE_NAME='$PROFILE_NAME'\\n\" >> \"$F\"\n\ncat >> \"$F\" <<\\EOF\n# Store the profile here:\nPROFILE_DIR=\"/Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/${PROFILE_NAME}\"\n\n# Find the Google Chrome binary:\nCHOME_BIN=\"/Users/$USER/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome\"\nif [[ ! -e \"$CHOME_BIN\" ]]; then\n  CHOME_BIN=\"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome\"\nelse\n  echo \"ERROR: Can not find Google Chrome.  Exiting.\"\n  exit -1\nfi\n\n# Start me up!\nexec \"$CHOME_BIN\" --enable-udd-profiles --user-data-dir=\"$PROFILE_DIR\"\nEOF\n\nsudo chmod +x \"$F\"\n\nSave it in a file (let's say create_second_chrome.sh in the Desktop folder), open the shell and execute it by passing as parameter the profile folder you want to associate to the second Chrome App. It will be called Google Chrome profile_folder_name. Let's suppose Google Chrome Development:\n$ cd ~/Desktop\n$ . create_second_chrome.sh Development\n\nNow you can launch the new version of Chrome (Google Chrome Development) from the ~/Applications directory. You can set a different icon by right-clicking on the app and selecting 'Get Info'. You will see that this new version has its own icon on the dock and can be docked there if needed.\n\u60c5\u5831\u5143\uff1a http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/66670/is-there-a-simple-way-to-have-separate-dock-icons-for-different-chrome-profiles\n\nFor having two Chrome running at the same time you need to create a second runnable Google Chrome App.\n\nYou can create that second application by running the following script.
